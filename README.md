Learning Data Science is an introductory textbook for data science
published by O'Reilly Media in 2023. It covers foundational skills in
programming and statistics that encompass the data science lifecycle. The
reader's assumed background is detailed in the [Preface][preface].

## Caveats

In fact, breaking the letter but not the spirit of the license, there is
a bug-fix in the `pandas_exercises.ipynb` and `sql_exercises.ipynb` notebooks,
which otherwise break on import with current Pandas.  See those files for
comment and detail, and [this
issue](https://github.com/DS-100/textbook/issues/172) for my report.
